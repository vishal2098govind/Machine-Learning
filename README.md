# Machine-Learning

I did a project in Machine Learning for an image classification task in which we designed a model using two layer neural networks to train 
the dataset of images containing either cats or either dogs which was downloaded from kaggle's Kernels Edition.

I used python and used TensorFlow to build the network of my model.
