# Image Classification Using TensorFLow     

I did a project in Machine Learning for an image classification task in which we designed a model using two layer neural networks to train 
the dataset of images containing either cats or either dogs which was downloaded from kaggle's Kernels Edition.

I used python and used TensorFlow to build the network of my model.


In this project, I initially trained my model using the original rgb dataset from kaggle
and then I converted the rgb dataset into images containing only one channel for H value once and again did the same only V value.
At the end I compared the training accuracy among the three cases stated.

I found according to my model which is of only two layered neural network, training accuracy came almost the same in the range of 50-60%.

Accuracy might have increased or varied if I would have increased the no.of layers in my model or might have used a Convolution Neural Network(CNN).
